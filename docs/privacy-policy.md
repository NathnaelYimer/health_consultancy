Last updated: 2025-12-16

This Privacy Policy explains how Dr. Abel Gedefaw Ali Health Consultancy ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses, discloses, and protects personal data collected through our website Dr. AbelHealthConsulting.org.

## Data we collect
- **Contact form data:** name, email, phone number, message, and optional attachments.
- **Consultation requests:** reason for consult, preferred contact times, and optional medical history. Do not submit sensitive health information via public contact forms unless explicitly instructed.
- **Usage data:** pages visited, IP address, device/browser metadata, and analytics cookies.

## How we use data
- To respond to inquiries and deliver requested services.
- To improve the website, content, and services via analytics.
- To share publications and updates if you subscribe.

## Data sharing and third parties
- We do not sell personal data. We may share data with service providers who process data on our behalf (hosting, email delivery, analytics). We require those providers to implement appropriate security measures.

## Consultation and health data
- If you submit health information, it will be used only to provide the requested service. Sensitive health information is treated as confidential. We store consultation records securely and limit access to authorized personnel.
- If offering telehealth, we will provide explicit consent flows and a separate data-handling description before any consultation begins.

## Cookies and tracking
- We use essential cookies for site functionality and optional analytics cookies. You can control cookie preferences via the cookie banner.

## Data retention
- Contact and consultation records are retained for as long as necessary to provide services and for legal compliance. By default, we retain contact/consultation records for 2 years unless otherwise required.

## Your rights
- You may request access, correction, deletion, or restriction of your personal data. To exercise rights, contact us at info@healthevidencepost.com.

## Security
- We use industry-standard security measures (HTTPS, access controls). However, no system is completely secure; if a breach occurs we will notify affected users and regulators as required by law.

## Changes to this policy
- We may update this policy; material changes will be posted with a revised date.
